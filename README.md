# Frame Dragging Detection Platform

## Overview
This application analyzes stellar motion around the galactic center to detect signatures of frame dragging - a relativistic effect predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity where a massive rotating object drags the fabric of spacetime around it.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing from Gaia source files
- Quality filtering of stellar data based on measurement errors and parameters
- Calculation of frame dragging signatures from proper motion data
- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals and p-value calculation
- Interactive visualization of stellar motion patterns
- Export capabilities for publication-quality figures
- Hypothesis testing framework with null model comparison
