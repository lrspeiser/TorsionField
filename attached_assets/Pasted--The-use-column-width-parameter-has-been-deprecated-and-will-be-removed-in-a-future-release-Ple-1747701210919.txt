Galactic Center Frame Dragging Analysis
This application analyzes stellar motion around the galactic center to detect signatures of frame dragging - a relativistic effect predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity where a massive rotating object drags the fabric of spacetime around it.

What is Frame Dragging?
Frame dragging is a relativistic effect where a massive rotating object (like Sagittarius A*, our galaxy's central black hole) drags the spacetime fabric around it, causing nearby objects to be pulled along in the direction of rotation.

This application analyzes stellar motion data from the Gaia catalog to detect these subtle signatures by:

Filtering high-quality stellar data
Calculating expected frame dragging effects
Performing statistical analysis
